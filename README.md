# Wavelet Features of the Thickness Map of Retinal Ganglion Cell-Inner Plexiform Layer Best Discriminate Prior Optic Neuritis in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis



Overview:
----------
Analyze wavelet features of topographic thickness maps of the retinal ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) and evaluate their discrimination ability in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and a history of optic neuritis (ON).
Trained logist regression model, SVM model and Elastic-Net model

Goal: 
----------
Explore the  bacterial translocation in tissues after EcoHIV-infection, and characterize the humanized mice model

The pipeline has 4 steps:

1. RNA-seq alignment-Bowtie2
2. Analyzed differentially expressed genes-DESeq2  
3. Performed gene ontology enrichment analysis-Gorilla
4. View information in bam files-Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)

Software:
----------
1. Bowtie2 -RNA-seq alignment
2. DESeq2  - Differential expressed genes analysis
3. Gorilla-  Gene ontology enrichment analysis
4. IGV-  Integrative Genomics Viewer
